The dataset includes 6295 images.
Emotions are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 10 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -8 and +8 degrees
* Random shear of between -8째 to +8째 horizontally and -6째 to +6째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
